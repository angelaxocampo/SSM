Now that you have successfully downloaded R and R Studio, and have a few classes under your belt, you are ready to begin practicing some of the skills and tools we are learning. 

# R and RStudio

Let's first discuss R and the RStudio window. 


The panel in the upper right contains your *workspace* as well as a history of the commands that you've previously entered.  Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens.  It's called the *console*. Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the  console telling you the version of R that you're running.  Below that 
information is the *prompt*.  As its name suggests, this prompt is really a  request, a request for a command.  Initially, interacting with R is all about 
typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax  have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a 
fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

You can use R as a calculator. To get you started, enter the following command at the R prompt (i.e. right after `>` on the console).  You can either type it in manually or copy and paste it from this document.

```{r}
2+2
```

And you can save this result to an object that you can access later

```{r}
x = 2+2
```

Try typing `x` in the console to verify that. 

You can also see this new object in your environment on the upper right pane.  Next time you log on to RStudio the object will still be here.

Throughout the semester you will learn about how to use R to do data analysis,  and in the meantime you will be exposed to some programming. In addition, you 
will learn best practices for saving your code and making sure that your  analysis is reproducible.


Now let's discuss R Markdown.

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for writing HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. You can also use this very useful cheat sheet <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, or images for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. However, if you want to include that into your file, you can set it to be `echo = TRUE` and it will print the R code when you **Knit** the document.

For your labs, make sure that you are printing only relevant R code and output in your R Markdown file.

## Creating a Reproducible Lab Report

We will be using a markdown language, R Markdown, to type up the lab reports. This allows you to complete your labs entirely in RStudio as well as ensuring reproducibility of your analysis and results. To help get you started we are providing a template for you. Use the following code to download this template:

```{r load-template}
download.file("https://github.com/angelaxocampo/SSM/raw/main/Lab_1/lab1.Rmd", destfile = "lab1.Rmd")
```

# Set Working Directory

Remember that for the first lab where you were supposed to set up a folder structure for your Lab 0. This time, you will set up a new folder structure for Lab 1. You will continue to do this for all of your future labs. 

# Loading data

We are going to begin by learning how to load data, deal with packages and other R functions. We will be using the 2006 Latino National Survey as our main data to practice all the tools and techniques we are learning.

This is how you load the data

```{r load, echo=TRUE}
load(url("https://github.com/angelaxocampo/SSM/raw/main/Lab_1/Data/LNS.rda"))

```

The data that you have loaded is now in your environment. You can now take a look at the data and begin to explore the variables in the data.

To look at the many variables that exist in the data set, you can type:

```{r load, echo=TRUE}
load(url("https://github.com/angelaxocampo/SSM/raw/main/Lab_1/Data/LNS.rda"))

```
